# Fatma Mohamed
I'm a front-end developer who is passionate about making responsive user interfaces. I love to learn new technologies and try them myself.
I was busy with my academic study for the past couple of years(2020 - 2021), and now I have ended it and continue to learn front-end development.
I have already learned basic web technologies and now I'm practicing it(more focus on JS) and learning JS frameworks (started with React).
